The utDataStoR package provides a centralized repository of standardized SQL queries and data collections, ensuring that university analysts have access to the same accurate code, while also being user-friendly to facilitate efficient and consistent report generation. Additionally, it enhances security by centralizing data management, facilitates cross-campus initiatives by providing a unified data source for collaborative projects, and plays a crucial role in data governance and supporting the Utah Tech University's mission by ensuring data integrity and compliance. Its intuitive design makes it easy to use, allowing analysts to quickly adopt and leverage its features without extensive training, and it can also accept recommendations for changes, which must be reviewed and approved by data governance to ensure continued alignment with university standards.

## Deliverables
