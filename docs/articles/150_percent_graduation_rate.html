<p>150 Percent Graduation Rate measures the percentage of a cohort of
students who graduate within 150% of time for their awarded degree. This
metric is meant to mimic the IPEDS graduation rate, but does not have
all of the nuance that the official IPEDS metric does.</p>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="cohort">Cohort<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#cohort"></a>
</h2>
<p>A cohort is a group of students with shared characteristics that are
tracked for reporting purposes. New, degree seeking students are
assigned a cohort when they enter the University. They are placed in a
cohort based on data in the census enrollment snapshot. There are eight
cohorts students are placed in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full-time, Bachelors degree seeking, freshman</li>
<li>Full-time, Bachelors degree seeking, transfer</li>
<li>Part-time, Bachelors degree seeking, freshman</li>
<li>Part-time, Bachelors degree seeking, transfer</li>
<li>Full-time, Associates degree seeking, freshman</li>
<li>Full-time, Associates degree seeking, transfer</li>
<li>Part-time, Associates degree seeking, freshman</li>
<li>Part-time, Associates degree seeking, transfer</li>
</ul>
<p>For information on how cohorts are created see
<code><a href="../articles/cohort.html">vignette("cohort")</a></code></p>

<h2 id="calculating-150-graduation-rate">Calculating 150% Graduation Rate<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#calculating-150-graduation-rate"></a>
</h2>
<p>Tracks two cohorts</p>
<ul>
<li>Full-time, Bachelors degree seeking, freshman</li>
<li>Full-time, Associates degree seeking, freshman</li>
</ul>
<p>The calculation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Starts with a cohort</li>
<li>Excludes Spring and Summer cohorts</li>
<li>Excludes Transfer cohorts</li>
<li>Excludes Part-time students</li>
<li>Removes exclusions</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>denominator</strong> for this metric is the number of
students who align with the points above.</p>
<p>The <strong>numerator</strong> for the metric is the number of
students from the denominator who earned a degree in 150% time for the
degree awarded.</p>
<p>150 percent graduation rate starts with a cohort of students and
tracks if the student graduated with a degree in 150% of time to the
degree from the cohort start date.</p>
<p>This metric has a 6-year lag since 150 percent of time for a
bachelors degree is 6 years. Students in the Fall 2016 cohort have
through Summer of 2022 to earn a bachelor’s degree.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="of-time">150% of time<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#of-time"></a>
</h3>
<p>Students must earn a degree from the start date of their cohort
year:</p>
<ul>
<li>Certificate &lt;= 29 credit hours within 1 year</li>
<li>Certificate 30 &lt; 60 credit hours with 1 1/2 years</li>
<li>Associates within 3 years</li>
<li>Bachelors within 6 years</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="degree-awarded">Degree Awarded<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#degree-awarded"></a>
</h3>
<p>The metric looks at the highest degree awarded to a student in 150%
of time. If a student earns more than one degree, but only one of them
was earned in 150% of time, only that degree will be reported. If they
have more than one degree earned in 150% of time, then the highest
degree awarded within 150% of time will be reported. If they have earned
a degree but it was not within 150% of time, it will not be
reported.</p>

<h3 id="graduation-rate-bachelor-degree-in-4-years">Graduation Rate Bachelor Degree In 4 Years<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#graduation-rate-bachelor-degree-in-4-years"></a>
</h3>
<p>Graduation Rate Bachelor Degree in 4 years is a sub metric of 150%
Graduation Rate. It is reported in the IPEDS report. This metric is
meant to mimic the IPEDS graduation rate, but does not have all of the
nuance that the official IPEDS metric does.</p>
<p>The cohort is Full-time, Bachelors degree seeking, freshman. The
denominator for this metric is the number of students within the
Full-time, Bachelors degree seeking, freshman cohort who do not have an
exclusion flag. The numerator for the metric is the number of students
from the denominator who do not have an exclusion flag and were
graduated in 100% of time (within 4 years) with a Bachelors degree.</p>

<p>Graduation Rate Bachelor Degree in 6 years is a sub metric of 150%
Graduation Rate. It is reported in the IPEDS report. This metric is
meant to mimic the IPEDS graduation rate, but does not have all of the
nuance that the official IPEDS metric does.</p>
<p>The cohort is Full-time, Bachelors degree seeking, freshman. The
denominator for this metric is the number of students within the
Full-time, Bachelors degree seeking, freshman cohort who do not have an
exclusion flag. The numerator for the metric is the number of students
from the denominator who do not have an exclusion flag and were
graduated in 150% of time (within 6 years) with a Bachelors degree.</p>
