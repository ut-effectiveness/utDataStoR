<p>Headcount is the measure of the net unduplicated number of students
enrolled at Utah Tech for a specific period of time.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Census Headcount</strong> is the net unduplicated number of
students enrolled as of the 15th day of instruction of an academic term.
Census headcount is based on snapshot data, this headcount returns a
static headcount and is used for reporting.</li>
<li>
<strong>End Of Term Headcount</strong> is the net unduplicated
number of students enrolled at the end of the semester and after the
high school concurrent enrollment grades are entered. Based on snapshot
data, this headcount returns a static headcount and is used for
reporting.
<!-- - **Enrollment Funnel Census Headcount** tracks the number of students at various stages within the enrollment funnel, categorized by student type and funnel status. It provides a snapshot at Census of how many students are at each stage of expressing interest in the university. -->

<p>Sections are a combination of the Subject Code (or course prefix),
the course number, and the section number (e.g., MATH1010 01). Each
section has only one CRN (course reference number) associated with it,
making this the lowest level in the hierarchy of courses, classes and
sections.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Census Section Count</strong> is the count of sections as of
the 15th day of instruction of an academic term. Census section count is
based on snapshot data and returns a static section count used for
reporting.</li>

<strong>End Of Term Section Count</strong> is the count of sections
at the end of the semester. Based on snapshot data, this count returns a
static count and is used for reporting.</li>

graph for headcount metrics is the calendar year of the term code
(i.e. term code - 202440, Fall 2024, is year 2024). Each headcount
metric has the 5 most recent years of data if it is available (Summer

<p>Retention is a measure of how many students return to UT. Retention
is calculated in 3 ways: cohort retention, come back rate, and return
rate.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cohort Retention starts with a cohort of students (a group of
students) and tracks if the student re-enrolls (or retains) in each
semester and removes exclusions.</li>
<li>Come Back Rate looks at the degree seeking students enrolled in each
semester and tracks if the student re-enrolls (or comes back) by a given
semester and removes exclusions.</li>
<li>Return Rate looks at the degree seeking students enrolled in each
semester and tracks if the student re-enrolls (or returns) or completes
a credential by a given semester and removes exclusions.</li>

<p>There are several metrics associated with retention rates.
<strong>Cohort Retention</strong> has the following metrics:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Fall to Fall Cohort Retention</strong> - Student was
enrolled at Fall Census in the First-time Freshman or Transfer Cohort
and returned the following fall term (fall 2). For example enrolled in
Fall 2020, returned Fall 2021.</li>
<li>
<strong>Returned 3rd Fall</strong> - Student was enrolled at Fall
Census in the First-time Freshman or Transfer Cohort and returned the
3rd Fall). For example enrolled in Fall 2020, returned Fall 2022.</li>
<li>
<strong>Returned 4th Fall</strong> - Student was enrolled at Fall
Census in the First-time Freshman or Transfer Cohort and returned the
4th Fall). For example enrolled in Fall 2020, returned Fall 2023.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Come Back Rate</strong> has the following metrics:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Fall to Spring Come Back Rate</strong> - Student was
enrolled at Fall Census and returned the following Spring term (second
semester). For example enrolled in Fall 2020, returned Spring 2021.</li>
<li>
<strong>Fall to Fall Come Back Rate</strong> - Student was enrolled
at Fall Census and returned the following fall term (fall 2). For
example enrolled in Fall 2020, returned Fall 2021.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Return Rate</strong> has the following metrics:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Fall to Spring Return Rate</strong> - Student was enrolled
at Fall Census and returned the following Spring term (second semester).
For example enrolled in Fall 2020, returned Spring 2021.</li>

<p>Data is reported by season (Fall, Spring, Summer) and Year. Season
and Year together is referred to as Term. The year in the table and
graph for retention metrics is the cohort year tied to the calendar year
of the cohort term code (i.e. cohort term code - 202440, Fall 2024, is
year 2024) or is the term year of the term being measured. The year is
not the reporting year. Each retention metric has the 5 most recent
years of data if it is available. If a retention metric needs 3 years to
have complete data (returned 4th fall), then the metric will show the
most recent complete data (Cohort retention returned 4th fall for the
2020 cohort will not be provided until Fall 2023).</p>

<h3 id="graduation-rate">Graduation Rate<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#graduation-rate"></a>
</h3>
<p><strong>150 Percent Graduation Rate</strong> tracks a cohort of
students (Full-time, Bachelors degree seeking, freshman &amp; Full-time,
Associates degree seeking, freshman), after removing exclusions, for 6
years to see if the student earns a credential within 150% of the degree
time (150% for a bachelor degree is 6 years) in a manner similar to
IPEDS Graduation Rate.</p>
<p>There are two submetrics for 150 Percent Graduation Rate:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Graduation Rate Bachelors Degree in 4 Years</strong> -
tracks the cohort of Full Time First Time Freshman Bachelor Degree
Seeking students, after removing exclusions, for 6 years to see the
percent of students who earned a bachelor degree within 4 years (100% of
time).</li>
<li>
<strong>Graduation Rate Bachelors Degree in 6 Years</strong> -
tracks the cohort of Full Time First Time Freshman Bachelor Degree
Seeking students, after removing exclusions, for 6 years to see the
percent of students who earned a bachelor degree within 6 years (150% of
time).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>200 Percent Graduation Rate</strong> tracks the cohort of
Full Time First Time Freshman Bachelor Degree Seeking students, after
removing exclusions, for 8 years to see the percent of students who
earned a bachelor degree within 8 years (200% of time) in a manner
similar to IPEDS Graduation Rate 200.</p>

Fall 2029.</p>
<!-- ### Admissions Enrollment Funnel Rates -->
<!-- Admissions Enrollment Funnel Rates are essential components of the university's enrollment process, providing insights into the effectiveness of various stages from initial interest to actual enrollment. They help the university understand and optimize their recruitment and admissions strategies. -->
<!-- There are four submetrics for Admissions Enrollment Funnel Rates -->
<!-- - **Inquiry or Prospect to Applicant Conversion Rate** Measures how well the university converts initial interest into starting applications. -->
<!-- - **Applicant to Admit Conversion Rate** Indicates the selectivity of the admissions process by showing the percentage of completed applications and are now fully admitted.. -->
<!-- - **Admit to Committed Conversion Rate** Reflects the university's ability to persuade admitted students to commit to enrolling. These are students who have indicated their intent to enroll. -->
<!-- - **Admit to Enrolled Conversion Rate** Shows the success in converting admitted students into enrolled students, highlighting the effectiveness of follow-up and enrollment processes. -->
<!-- #### Year -->
<!-- Data is reported by season (Fall, Spring) and Year. Season and Year together is referred to as Term. Each Enrollment Funnel metric has the 5 most recent years of data if it is available. -->

<p>Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) is the number of students the university
would have if all students were attending full-time. It is calculated on
student credit hours and course level. FTE for undergraduate students
takes the total undergraduate student credit hours and divides it by 15
credit hours. FTE for graduate students takes the total graduate student
credit hours and divides it by 10 credit hours.</p>
<p><strong>Census FTE</strong> is the FTE on the 15th day of instruction
of an academic term. Census FTE is based on snapshot data, and is used
for reporting. <strong>End Of Term FTE</strong> is the FTE at the end of
the semester. End of Term FTE is based on snapshot data, and is used for
reporting.</p>
