**Course, Class, and Section counts** analyze course data to create enrollment counts based on different groupings of courses and sections.

## Course Counts
This is the highest level in the hierarchy. Courses are identified by a combination of the Subject Code (or course prefix) and the course number (e.g., MATH1010). A course may have multiple CRNs (course reference numbers) associated with it.

## Class Counts
This is the middle level in the hierarchy. Classes are adjusted sections that account for cross-listed and team-taught courses. Sections with cross listings are combined into one class, with an adjusted enrollment that sums the parent and child sections. For team-taught courses, sections are split into multiple classes (based on the number of instructors), with enrollment adjusted according to the percentage of workload assigned to each instructor.

## Section Counts
This is the lowest level in the hierarchy. Sections are identified by the combination of the Subject Code (or course prefix), the course number (e.g., MATH1010), and the section number. Each section has only one CRN (course reference number) associated with it.
