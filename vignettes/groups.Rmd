Groups define the ways students are categorized. These groups can be placed in several classifications.

# Demographic Groups
Data in this classification is collected from the student at the time of their application for admission. This data is stored at the student level, in the student table. This data is doesn't change often, if ever. This data can be pulled as of Current, End of Term or Census.

## Gender
Gender is the biological sex on a student's birth certificate. The options are:

- Male 
- Female
- Unspecified

## IPEDS Race/Ethnicity
IPEDS Race/Ethnicity is data reporting the student's race and ethnicity where the multiracial students are grouped into one category. There are nine options:

- Hispanic
- American Indian/Alaskan
- Asian
- Black/African American
- Hawaiian/Pacific Islander
- White
- Multiracial
- Non-Resident Alien (for those with visa's)
- Unspecified

## Minority
Minority students are those students who are not white, non-resident alien, or unspecified. The options are:

- Minority
- Non-minority

## BIPOC
BIPOC students are those whose race/ethnicity is black, indigenous, or other people of color (Hispanic, Asian and multiracial). The options are:

- BIPOC
- non-BIPOC

## Citizenship
Citizenship is the student's relationship to the United States. The options are:

- 1 - US Citizen
- 2 - Non-Res Alien-Visa or temp bas
- 3 - Res Alien-immigrant status
- 4 - Non-Citizen National of US
- 5 - Non-immigrant Alien 53B-8-106
- 6 - Deferred Action
- 9 - Student curr defined as Other

## International Student
An international student is a student who is from a foreign country (has a citizenship code of Non_Res Alien-Visa) and comes to the US to take classes on a temporary F-1 visa. This is a subset of Non-Resident Alien students (see IPEDS Race/Ethnicity). If the sql output is TRUE then the student is an international student. 

## Age Band
Age is how old a student is today (or on the day of the snapshot) based on their birth date. Reported as a grouping: 

- Less than 18
- 18-24
- 25-34
- 35-44
- 44-59
- 60 plus

## First Generation Student
A first generation student is a student where neither parent nor guardian has received their bachelor's degree. On the application the student is asked if either of their parent(s) or guardian(s) has received a bachelor degree, if they respond no then the student is a first generation student. If they respond yes or if they don't answer then the student is not a first generation student. If the sql output is TRUE then the student is a first generation student.

## Veteran
A veteran is a student who has served in the armed forces or is receiving veteran benefits (includes family members receiving benefits). If the sql output is TRUE then the student is a veteran.

## Student Athlete
A student athlete is a student who was EVER on the official team roster on or after the first scheduled contest or date of NCAA competition. If the sql output is TRUE then the student is an athlete.

## First Admit Country
First admit country is the the country listed on the students first application where they were admitted.

## First Admit State
First admit state is the the state listed on the students first application where they were admitted. Students who were not in the US get grouped into Foreign State.

## First Admit County
First admit county is the the county listed on the student first application where they were admitted. Students who were not from Utah get grouped into Out of state, in US; or Out of state, out of US.

## ACT Composite Score
ACT Composite Score is the student's highest ACT composite score. The Composite score is the average of the four ACT test scores (Math, English, Reading, Science), rounded to the nearest whole number.

# Term Based Groups
Data in this classification can change each semester and is based on information from the system for this current term such as program, student type, etc. This data is stored at the student term level, in the student_term_level table. This data changes often. This data can be pulled as of Current, End of Term or Census.

## College

Includes students enrolled in the fall term who attended college for the first time in the prior summer term, and students who entered with advanced standing (college credits earned  before graduation from high school (e.g., advanced placement and  concurrent enrollment)). A student will be coded as a freshman only once.

- R	- Readmit - A student who has re-enrolled at the institution  after stopping out for at least one term (excluding summer term).
- T -	Transfer - A student entering the reporting institution for the first time but known to have previously attended a post secondary institution at the same level (e.g., undergraduate,  graduate). This includes new students enrolled in the fall term who transferred into the institution the prior summer term. The student may transfer with or without credit. A student will be coded as a transfer only once.
- P	- Personal Interest, Non-Degree - A student who is taking courses without applying for candidacy for a degree or certificate.
- 1	- New Graduate - A student who holds a bachelors or first professional degree, or equivalent, and is taking courses at the post baccalaureate level for the first time. These students may or may not be enrolled in graduate programs. A student will be coded as a new graduate only once.
- 2	- Transfer Graduate - A student entering the reporting institution at the graduate level for the first time but known to have previously attended another post secondary institution at the graduate level. The student may transfer in with or without credit. A student will be coded as a transfer graduate only once.

# Course Based Groups
Data in this classification can change each day and is different each semester. It is based on courses the student is enrolled in.

## High School Concurrent Enrollment Student
A High School Concurrent Enrollment student is a high school student enrolled in at least one funded concurrent enrollment class. High School Concurrent Enrollment students are a subset of High School Students. If a high school student isn't a concurrent enrollment student then the student is a High School Student, Other. If the sql output is TRUE then the student is a high school concurrent enrollment student.


## SQL for High School Concurrent Enrollment Student
```sql

## Distance Education Status
Distance Education Status determines if a students' courses are Distance Education All, Distance Education Some, or Distance Education None. A distance education course uses one or more types of technology to deliver instruction to students who are separated from the instructor and to support regular and substantive interaction between the students and the instructor synchronously or asynchronously.

## SQL for Distance Education Status

```sql
--This query will pull current data from the current term (use student_term_level_version to pull snapshot data)

 WHERE a.is_enrolled IS TRUE
   AND a.is_primary_level IS TRUE
   AND a.is_current_term IS TRUE
 ```

## Online Status
Online Status determines if a students courses are Online All, Online Some, or Online None. An online course is a subset of distance education courses. Online courses are primarily delivered asynchronously; students work at their own pace within the timelines established by the instructor. 

## SQL for Online Status

```sql
--This query will pull current data from the current term (use student_section_version to pull snapshot data)

## Student Category
A student's category is based off of their degree seeking status. The options are:

- Degree Seeking
- Non-Matriculated
- High School Concurrent Enrollment Students
- High School Students, Other

## SQL for Student Category
```sql
