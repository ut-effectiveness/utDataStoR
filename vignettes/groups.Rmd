Groups define the ways students are categorized. These groups can be placed in several classifications.

# Demographic Groups
Data in this classification is collected from students during their application for admission. It is stored at the student level in the student table and typically remains unchanged over time. This data can be retrieved as of Current, End of Term, or Census. Demographic data generally remains stable and rarely changes.

## Gender
Gender is the biological sex on a student's birth certificate. Not Available is used if the code is null. The options are:

- M - Male 
- F - Female
- N - Not Available

## IPEDS Race/Ethnicity
IPEDS Race/Ethnicity is data reporting the student's race and ethnicity where the multiracial students are grouped into one category. There are nine options:

- Hispanic
- American Indian/Alaskan
- Asian
- Black/African American
- Hawaiian/Pacific Islander
- White
- Multiracial
- Non-Resident Alien (Non-U.S. Citizen on Visa)
- Unspecified

## Minority
Minority students are those students who are not white, non-resident alien, or unspecified. The options are:

- Minority
- Non-minority

## Citizenship
Citizenship is the student's relationship to the United States. The options are:

- 1 - US Citizen - An individual who is a citizen of the United States, regardless of how his/her status was acquired.
- 2 - Non-Res Alien-Visa or temp bas - An individual who is not a citizen or national of the United States and who is in this country on a Visa or temporary basis and does not have the right to remain indefinitely.

## International Student
An international student is a student who is from a foreign country (has a citizenship code of Non_Res Alien-Visa) and comes to the US to take classes on a temporary F-1 visa. This is a subset of Non-Resident Alien students (see IPEDS Race/Ethnicity). If the sql output is TRUE then the student is an international student.

## First Generation Student
A first generation student is a student where neither parent nor guardian has received their bachelor's degree. On the application the student is asked if either of their parent(s) or guardian(s) has received a bachelor degree, if they respond no then the student is a first generation student. If they respond yes or if they don't answer then the student is not a first generation student. If the sql output is TRUE then the student is a first generation student.

## First Admit State
First admit state refers to the state listed on a student’s initial application at the time they were admitted. Students who were not in the US get grouped into Foreign State.

## First Admit Country

Starting in Sept. 2025, the composite score is an average of three ACT test scores (Math, English, Reading), rounded to the nearest whole number. If the student has not taken the ACT then this field is null.


# Term Based Groups
Data in this classification can change each semester and is based on information from the system for this current term such as program, student type, etc. This data is stored at the student term level, in the student_term_level table. This data changes often. This data can be pulled as of Current, End of Term or Census.

## Non-Matriculated
A non-matriculated student is a non-degree-seeking student who is enrolled to pursue personal interests rather than a credential. Non-matriculated students are a subset of Non-Degree-Seeking. If the sql output returns TRUE, the student is classified as non-matriculated.

## SQL for Demographic and Term Based Groups

```sql
`r display_sql_with_comments('headcount', 'headcount_census_groups.sql')`
```


# Course Based Groups
Data in this classification can change daily and varies by semester. It is based on the courses in which a student is enrolled and is stored at the student term section level in the student_term_section table. Because enrollment can change frequently, this data is highly dynamic. It can be retrieved as of Current, End of Term, or Census.

## High School Concurrent Enrollment Student
A High School Concurrent Enrollment student is a high school student enrolled in at least one funded concurrent enrollment class. High School Concurrent Enrollment students are a subset of High School Students. If a high school student isn't a concurrent enrollment student then the student is a High School Student, Other. If the sql output is TRUE then the student is a high school concurrent enrollment student.


## SQL for High School Concurrent Enrollment Student
```sql
--This query will pull current data from the current term (use student_term_level_version to pull snapshot data)
WITH cte AS
           (
               SELECT a.budget_code,

                      a.course_id,
                      a.term_id
                 FROM export.student_section a
                          LEFT JOIN export.student_term_level b

       a.term_id,
       bool_or(cte_concurrent_enrollment) AS is_concurrent_enrollment
  FROM concurrent_cte a
 GROUP BY a.student_id, a.term_id
```

## Distance Education Status
Distance Education Status determines if a student's courses are Distance Education All, Distance Education Some, or Distance Education None. A distance education course uses one or more types of technology to deliver instruction to students who are separated from the instructor and to support regular and substantive interaction between the students and the instructor synchronously or asynchronously.

## SQL for Distance Education Status

```sql
--This query will pull current data from the current term (use student_term_level_version to pull snapshot data)
SELECT a.student_id,
       a.is_distance_ed_all,
       a.is_distance_ed_some,
       a.is_distance_ed_none
  FROM export.student_term_level a
 WHERE a.is_enrolled IS TRUE
   AND a.is_primary_level IS TRUE
   AND a.is_current_term IS TRUE
 ```

## Online Status
Online Status determines if a students courses are Online All, Online Some, or Online None. An online course is a subset of distance education courses. Online courses are primarily delivered asynchronously; students work at their own pace within the timelines established by the instructor. 

## SQL for Online Status

```sql
--This query will pull current data from the current term (use student_section_version to pull snapshot data)
SELECT student_id,
       instruction_method_code_aggregated,
       instruction_method_code_aggregated !~ '[I]'  AS online_none,
       instruction_method_code_aggregated !~ '[^I]' AS online_all,
       CASE
           WHEN instruction_method_code_aggregated !~ '[^I]' THEN FALSE
           WHEN instruction_method_code_aggregated ~ '[I]+' THEN TRUE
           ELSE FALSE
           END                                      AS online_some,

        AND season != 'Summer'
      GROUP BY a.student_id,
               b.academic_year_code) x
   ```

## Student Category
A student's category is based off of their degree seeking status. The options are:

- Degree Seeking
- Non-Matriculated
- High School Concurrent Enrollment Students
- High School Students, Other
