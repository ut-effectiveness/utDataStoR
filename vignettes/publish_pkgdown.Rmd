## How to Republish the `utDataStoR` R Package to the GitHub "pkgdown" Site (RStudio Workflow)

These steps guide you through updating the [`ut-effectiveness/utDataStoR`](https://github.com/ut-effectiveness/utDataStoR) pkgdown site using only RStudio.

### Prerequisites

- You have push access to the `ut-effectiveness/utDataStoR` repository.
- R and RStudio are installed.
- R packages required: `pkgdown`, `devtools` (and any other package dependencies).

---

### Step 1: Open or Pull the Latest Version of the Project in RStudio

- Open RStudio.
- Use **File > Open Project** to open your local copy of `utDataStoR`.
- To update to the latest version, use the **Git** tab and click **Pull** to fetch any new changes.

---

### Step 2: Install Package Dependencies

In the **Console** pane at the bottom of RStudio, run:

```r
install.packages(c("devtools", "pkgdown"))
devtools::install_deps(dependencies = TRUE)
```

---

### Step 3: Build the "pkgdown" Site

In the Console, run:

```r
pkgdown::build_site()
```

This will regenerate the documentation website in the `docs/` folder.

---

### Step 4: Review Your Changes

- Use the **Files** pane to explore the new/updated files in the `docs/` directory.

---

### Step 5: Commit and Push Changes from RStudio

1. Go to the **Git** tab in RStudio.
2. Stage the changes by ticking the box next to modified files (especially any changes in `docs/`).
3. Write a commit message (e.g., "Update pkgdown site").
4. Click **Commit**.
5. Click **Push** to upload your changes to GitHub.

---

### Step 6: Verify GitHub Pages Is Set Up

- Visit your repository on GitHub: https://github.com/ut-effectiveness/utDataStoR
- Go to **Settings > Pages**
- Ensure that Pages is set to build from the `/docs` folder on your default branch.

---

### Step 7: View the Updated Site

After a few minutes, check your updated site at:
`https://ut-effectiveness.github.io/utDataStoR/`

---

### Troubleshooting

- If the documentation does not update, double-check that you have committed and pushed the contents of the `docs/` folder.
- Ensure `pkgdown::build_site()` runs without errors (consider resolving any missing dependencies).
- If you see a 404 or blank site, re-check your repository's GitHub Pages settings.
