## Undergraduate FTE

Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) is the number of students the university would have if all students were attending full-time. It is calculated on course level student credit hours.

FTE for undergraduate students takes the total undergraduate student credit hours and divides it by 15 credit hours.

## Graduate FTE

FTE for graduate students takes the total graduate student credit hours and divides it by 10 credit hours.

FTE is reported to USHE five times per fiscal year:

-   Summer End of Term
-   Fall 3rd Week Census
-   Fall End of Term
-   Spring 3rd Week Census
-   Spring End of Term

USHE summarizes FTE by credit hour type, residency, gender, and budget.

IPEDS calculates FTE in the 12 Month Enrollment survey based on a reporting calendar from July 1, 20XX - June 20YY. Utah Tech excludes Summer academic terms and reports Spring and Fall term census data.
