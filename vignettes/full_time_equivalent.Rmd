Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) is the number of students the university would have if all students were attending full-time. It is calculated on course level student credit hours.

FTE for undergraduate students takes the total undergraduate student credit hours (from the student section version table) and divides it by 15 credit hours. FTE for graduate students takes the total graduate student credit hours (from the student section version table) and divides it by 10 credit hours. The total FTE is the sum of undergraduate and graduate FTE.

## Current FTE

The Current FTE reflects the live count of FTE for a term, which can fluctuate daily and may be adjusted post-semester for changes like withdrawals.

```sql
`r display_sql_with_comments('fte', 'fte_total_current.sql')`
```

## Census FTE
The Census FTE is a fixed sum of FTE at the 15th day of the term, used for static reporting.

```sql
`r display_sql_with_comments('fte', 'fte_total_census.sql')`
```

## End of Term FTE
The End of Term FTE is a fixed sum of FTE at the semesters end, used for static reporting.

```sql
`r display_sql_with_comments('fte', 'fte_total_end_of_term.sql')`
```

## USHE FTE

FTE is reported to USHE five times per fiscal year:

Summer End of Term
Fall 3rd Week Census
Fall End of Term
Spring 3rd Week Census
Spring End of Term
USHE summarizes FTE by credit hour type, residency, gender, and budget.

## USHE Annualized FTE

USHE Annualized FTE is determined by summing the total of each undergraduate and graduate FTE from the three end-of-term snapshots for each academic term within a reporting year (e.g., Summer 2023, Fall 2023, Spring 2024 for the USHE Reporting Year 2023-24) and then dividing this total by 2.

## IPEDS 12 Month Enrollment

IPEDS 12 Month Enrollment FTE is calculated by summing the number of attempted credits for undergraduate and graduate students from the three census snapshots for each academic term within a reporting year (e.g., Summer 2023, Fall 2023, Spring 2024 for the IPEDS data collection period 2023-24, reported in the 2024-25 IPEDS survey series). The undergraduate total credits attempted are divided by 30 (fifteen times two), and the graduate credits attempted are divided by 24 (twelve times two) to calculate the 12 Month Enrollment FTE by academic year. This calculation is verified in the 2024-25 data collection tutorial of the 12-Month Enrollment Component/FTE Enrollment-Credit Hours training materials provided by the Association for Institutional Research(AIR).
