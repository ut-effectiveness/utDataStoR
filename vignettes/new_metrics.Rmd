## New Metric(s)

So, you think you need a new metric...

Metrics have several components

- Season
- Computation
- Partition
- Segment

For a description and examples of these, please see `vignettes/utMetrics.Rmd`

New metrics require varying degrees of work. The amount of work required for each request will determine how quickly the metrics can be created. #todo Should I provide an estimate of how long each level will take? Should I discuss the IE office working on them once a month? Should I mention that the IE office will make the final determination of what level the metric is?

- Level 1 - A new partition is needed for an existing computation
- Level 2 - A new computation is needed for a similar computation (for example the institution has Returned 4th Fall Cohort Retention, but you want to see Returned 5th Fall Cohort Retention)
- Level 3 - A new computation and partitions are needed

### Requesting New Metrics

To request a new metric please send a spreadsheet with the following columns to datablaze@utahtech.edu

Columns

- Requested Data Point (Required) - The metric you want, you can word it in ways that makes sense to you
- Metric (Optional) - The official metric name, in the official metric format (Season Computation by Partition::Segment); feel free to put this in if you think you know what it is
- Computation (Optional) - The official computation name, if you know it
- Partition (Optional) - The official partition name, if you know it
- Segment (Optional) - The official segment name, if you know it
- Notes (Optional) - Information you want the OIE office to know regarding the metric


## For the Analyst
Once you get the spreadsheet from the requester, make sure it has the following columns:

- Requested Data Point - Provided by the requester 
- Metric - The official metric name, in the official metric format (Season Computation by Partition::Segment); if provided it is verified by the analyst; used to join to df_metrics_indices to provide the computation, partition, segment, year, season, value
- Computation - The official computation name, provided by df_metrics_indices
- Partition - The official partition name, provided by df_metrics_indices
- Segment - The official segment name, provided by df_metrics_indices
- Year - The year of the metric, provided by df_metrics_indices
- Season - The season of the metric, provided by df_metrics_indices
- Metric Value - The metric value either the metric_number or the metric_number_char, provided by df_metrics_indices
- DRI - The directly responsible individual
- Source - Where did the data come from, typically utMetrics
- Issue - The name of the issue in utMetrics
- Notes - Additional information regarding the metric provided by the requester
