utMetrics provides the official metrics of Utah Tech University. These metrics can be used in both internal and external presentations regarding Utah Tech University. If you need metrics that you can't find here, please reach out to the Insitutional Effecitiveness office (datablaze@utahtech.edu) to receive those metrics.

## Install utMetrics
utMetrics is a package in R. 
For reporting install the current version of utMetrics from GitHub

devtools::install_github("ut-effectiveness/utMetrics",
                        auth_token = gitcreds::gitcreds_get()$password,
                        force = TRUE, 
                        build_vignettes = TRUE)



the data frames available
when to use which data frame
define the fields in each data frame
how to search the data frames and other vignettes to look at for more information
give examples of code to use to pull metrics
give examples of narrowing down the results to a specific year
give examples of narrowing down the result to a specific segment (show the metric_segment_index and the metric_segement_season_index)
give examples of using the metric and the metric index
give examples using the metric_number and the metric_number_char and describe when you would use each
give examples of the outputs
note how to request new metrics or new partitions (examples)
Here is some starting code:
headcount <- utMetrics::df_metrics_indices %>%
filter(computation == 'Census Headcount'
& partition == 'Student Type'
& season == 'Fall') %>%
select(year, segment, metric_number_char) %>%
rename(Count = metric_number_char,
"Student Type" = segment,
Year = year) %>%
arrange(Year, "Student Type") %>%
unique()
