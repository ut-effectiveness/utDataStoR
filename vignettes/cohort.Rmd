A cohort is a classification assigned to new, undergraduate degree-seeking students upon entry to the University, based on shared characteristics for reporting purposes. Cohorts are determined using census enrollment snapshot data.

Students are assigned to one of eight cohorts:

- Full-time, Bachelors degree seeking, Freshman
- Full-time, Bachelors degree seeking, Transfer
- Part-time, Bachelors degree seeking, Freshman
- Part-time, Bachelors degree seeking, Transfer
- Full-time, Associates degree seeking, Freshman
- Full-time, Associates degree seeking, Transfer
- Part-time, Associates degree seeking, Freshman
- Part-time, Associates degree seeking, Transfer

## Criteria for Cohort Assignment:

Cohort assignment is driven by the following fields:

- Enrollment status (full-time/part-time) based on credits at census.
- Identified as bachelors or associates degree-seeking at census.
- Level id of Undergraduate at census.
- Degree level (primary degree ID) of the declared program at census.
- Student type of Freshman or Transfer at census.

- Students are placed in a cohort once, during the term where they are classified as Freshman (F) or Transfer (T). These student types are undergraduate degree-seeking students. 

- Once assigned, students remain in their cohort. Readmitted students retain their original cohort.

- When a student with the student type of High School (H) enrolls as a degree seeking student after they graduate from high school they are assigned a student type of Freshman (F) or Transfer (T) and are placed in a cohort.

## Non-Cohort Students:

- Graduate students are not assigned a cohort.
  - *While graduate students may have been part of a cohort during their undergraduate studies, no cohort assignments are made for graduate students.* 

- Non degree-seeking students.

- When a student with a student type of Personal Interest, Non-Degree (P) moves into a degree-seeking program, they do not get placed in a cohort. They move from a student type of Personal Interest, Non-Degree (P) to Continuing Registration (C). Because they never have a student type of Freshman (F) or Transfer (T) they are never placed in a cohort.

- Cohorts prior to 2009 are not in Edify. If a student was placed in a cohort before 2009, they are non-cohorted or null.
	
- Students who had an incorrect student type assignment at Census that should have been a Freshman (F) or Transfer (T) are not placed in a cohort. 
	
## Exclusions

- Exclusions apply to students who have passed away, are permanently disabled, or have left for military service, federal aid service, or official church missions.
