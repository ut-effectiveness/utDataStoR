150 Percent Graduation Rate measures the percentage of a cohort of students who graduate within 150% of time for their awarded degree. This metric is meant to mimic the IPEDS graduation rate, but does not have all of the nuance that the official IPEDS metric does.

## Cohort

A cohort is a group of students with shared characteristics that are tracked for reporting purposes. New, degree seeking students are assigned a cohort when they enter the University. They are placed in a cohort based on data in the census enrollment snapshot. There are eight cohorts students are placed in:

- Full-time, Bachelors degree seeking, freshman
- Full-time, Bachelors degree seeking, transfer
- Part-time, Bachelors degree seeking, freshman
- Part-time, Bachelors degree seeking, transfer
- Full-time, Associates degree seeking, freshman
- Full-time, Associates degree seeking, transfer
- Part-time, Associates degree seeking, freshman
- Part-time, Associates degree seeking, transfer

For information on how cohorts are created see `vignette("cohort")`
## Calculating 150% Graduation Rate

Tracks two cohorts, the Full-time, Bachelors degree seeking, freshman and Full-time, Associates degree seeking, freshman.

The calculation:

- Starts with a cohort
- Excludes Spring and Summer cohorts
- Excludes Transfer cohorts
- Excludes Part-time students
- Removes exclusions

The **denominator** for this metric is the number of students who align with the points above. 

The **numerator** for the metric is the number of students from the denominator who earned a degree in 150% time for the degree awarded. 

150 percent graduation rate starts with a cohort of students and tracks if the student graduated with a degree in 150% of time to the degree from the cohort start date. 

This metric has a 6-year lag since 150 percent of time for a bachelors degree is 6 years. Students in the Fall 2016 cohort have through Summer of 2022 to earn a bachelor's degree.

### 150% of time
Students must earn a degree from the start date of their cohort year:

- Certificate <= 29 credit hours within 1 year
- Certificate 30 < 60 credit hours with 1 1/2 years
- Associates within 3 years
- Bachelors within 6 years

### Degree Awarded
The metric looks at the highest degree awarded to a student in 150% of time. If a student earns more than one degree, but only one of them was earned in 150% of time, only that degree will be reported. If they have more than one degree earned in 150% of time, then the highest degree awarded within 150% of time will be reported. If they have earned a degree but it was not within 150% of time, it will not be reported.
