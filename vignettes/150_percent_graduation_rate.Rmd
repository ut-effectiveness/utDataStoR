150 Percent Graduation Rate measures the percentage of a cohort of students who graduate within 150% of time for their awarded degree. This metric is meant to mimic the IPEDS graduation rate, but does not have all of the nuance that the official IPEDS metric does.

## Cohort

A cohort is a group of students with shared characteristics that are tracked for reporting purposes. New, degree seeking students are assigned a cohort when they enter the University. They are placed in a cohort based on data in the census enrollment snapshot. There are eight cohorts students are placed in:

- Full-time, Bachelors degree seeking, freshman
- Full-time, Bachelors degree seeking, transfer
- Part-time, Bachelors degree seeking, freshman
- Part-time, Bachelors degree seeking, transfer
- Full-time, Associates degree seeking, freshman
- Full-time, Associates degree seeking, transfer
- Part-time, Associates degree seeking, freshman
- Part-time, Associates degree seeking, transfer

For information on how cohorts are created see 'vignette("cohort")'

## Calculating 150% Graduation Rate

Tracks two cohorts

- Full-time, Bachelors degree seeking, freshman
- Full-time, Associates degree seeking, freshman

The calculation:

- Starts with a cohort
- Excludes Spring and Summer cohorts
- Excludes Transfer cohorts
- Excludes Part-time students
- Removes exclusions

The **denominator** for this metric is the number of students who align with the points above. 

The **numerator** for the metric is the number of students from the denominator who earned a degree in 150% time for the degree awarded. 

150 percent graduation rate starts with a cohort of students and tracks if the student graduated with a degree in 150% of time to the degree from the cohort start date. 

This metric has a 6-year lag since 150 percent of time for a bachelors degree is 6 years. Students in the Fall 2016 cohort have through Summer of 2022 to earn a bachelor's degree.

### 150% of time
Students must earn a degree from the start date of their cohort year:

- Certificate <= 29 credit hours within 1 year
- Certificate 30 < 60 credit hours with 1 1/2 years
- Associates within 3 years
- Bachelors within 6 years

### Graduation Rate Bachelor Degree In 4 Years

Graduation Rate Bachelor Degree in 4 years is a sub metric of 150% Graduation Rate. It is reported in the IPEDS report. This metric is meant to mimic the IPEDS graduation rate, but does not have all of the nuance that the official IPEDS metric does.

The cohort is Full-time, Bachelors degree seeking, freshman. The denominator for this metric is the number of students within the Full-time, Bachelors degree seeking, freshman cohort who do not have an exclusion flag. The numerator for the metric is the number of students from the denominator who do not have an exclusion flag and were graduated in 100% of time (within 4 years) with a Bachelors degree.

### Graduation Rate Bachelor Degree In 6 Years

Graduation Rate Bachelor Degree in 6 years is a sub metric of 150% Graduation Rate. It is reported in the IPEDS report. This metric is meant to mimic the IPEDS graduation rate, but does not have all of the nuance that the official IPEDS metric does.

The cohort is Full-time, Bachelors degree seeking, freshman. The denominator for this metric is the number of students within the Full-time, Bachelors degree seeking, freshman cohort who do not have an exclusion flag. The numerator for the metric is the number of students from the denominator who do not have an exclusion flag and were graduated in 150% of time (within 6 years) with a Bachelors degree.
