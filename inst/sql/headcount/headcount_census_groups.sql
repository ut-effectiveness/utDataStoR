/*
Headcount census groups
Approved on
provides unit record data, for students enrolled in census (see where a.version_desc = 'Census')
for the most recent year plus 5 years of data (see where add DATE_Part)
it provides student demographic and term data
to get headcount you must group and summarize
this query uses student_term_level_version as the base table and joins to the student_version table
Definitions for each of these groups can be found in the groups vignette in utDataStoR
